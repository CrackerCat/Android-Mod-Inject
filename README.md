This Was Converted Into Injector By NepMods.


How To Use:

To Send Boolean/int you can use


Send(f::feature, value);


to receive 



else if(request.Mode == f::f6) {
    featureHookToggle = request.boolean;
 }
else if(request.Mode == f::f6) {
       SeekBarValue = request.value;
  }


all is Same Like Lgl Android-ModMenu 2.9
in fact, it Android-modmenu 2.9 was converted into injector.


Its Not clean project. If You can use, and Improove, you can do.i will
keep updating this project.


and I am begging you, if you dont have basic knowladge about c++, java and 
other small things, learn them first and Start modding
